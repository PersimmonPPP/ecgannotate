# Statistics

The dataset contains 48 half-hour 2-channel ECG records from 47 individual subjects. Sampling rate is 360 samples per second with cardiologist arrhythmia annotations available for each record. The raw ECG signals are readable into Python using the "pandas" module since the dataset is in .csv format.

The ECG signals are readable into Python and thus are valid input data for testing the developed ECG GUI in Python code.
