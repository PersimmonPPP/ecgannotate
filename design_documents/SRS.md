
## ECGannotate

# 1. Introduction

A Graphical User Interface for reading and annotating electrocardiogram (ECG) signals. 

# 2. Data Requirements

The GUI requires a dataset of ECG signals readable using Python code. The ECG signals should be raw signals collected from hospital patients and not synthetically generated. Corresponding annotations such as arrhythmia markers would be helpful for developing the annotation section of the GUI.

# 3. Datasets Used

The MIT-BIH dataset publicly available on Physionet https://physionet.org/content/mitdb/1.0.0/
